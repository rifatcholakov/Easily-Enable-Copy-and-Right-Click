## ✨ Key Features

- **✅ Unblock Everything:** Instantly restores Context Menu, Copy, Cut, Paste, and Text Selection functionality.
- **🏠 Local File Support:** Works on local HTML files (e.g., `file:///C:/Users/name/Desktop/test.html`) — perfect for offline documentation.
- **🎯 Per-Site Control:** The extension is disabled by default. You choose exactly which websites it runs on.
- **⌨️ Restores Shortcuts:** Successfully intercepts and allows keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+A`, and `Ctrl+P`.
- **💎 Clean UI:** A modern, minimalist popup interface built with React that perfectly adapts to your system's Light/Dark mode.
- **⚡ Zero Overhead:** Uses optimized DOM event capturing—only injecting the exact logic needed for the specific site.
- **🔒 Privacy First:** Your data never leaves your browser. No analytics, no tracking.

## 🛠️ How it Works

The extension works by injecting a tiny, highly-optimized content script that intercepts malicious scripts trying to block your actions:
1. **CSS Overrides:** It dynamically injects `user-select: auto !important` and other visual fixes via the `cssBlocker` module.
2. **Event Interception:** It captures DOM events (`contextmenu`, `copy`, `selectstart`, `keydown`) during the *capture phase* via the `eventBlocker` module and immediately stops propagation.
3. **State Management:** Uses Chrome's `storage.local` API to remember your exact preference for every hostname or local file you visit.
4. **Site Identification:** Uses a centralized `siteUtils` module to identify sites and format hostnames for a consistent user experience.
